					<h2>
						Hi there!
					</h2>

					<p class="text-block">
						So you're wondering <strong>who I am?</strong> You've come to the right place...

						</br>
						</br>

						I'm Alasdair Smith, known to most people as Ali, hence the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Baba_and_the_Forty_Thieves">40 Thieves thing</a>.

						</br>
						</br>

						I'm a Web Technologies student at Portsmouth University, on the south cost of England. What does that mean? I am learning to design and build awesome websites, like this one (or will be some day). I'm interested in using the possibilities of the web to make the world better, or something like that. Yep, I'm that geeky.

						</br>
						</br>

						I'm usually found hanging around <a href="http://twitter.com/40_thieves">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108476724320134244901">Google+</a> and occasionally my <a href="http://40thiev.es">blog</a>. I tend to write about and link to stuff that interests me, from internet politics to Scouts, and science to climbing.

						</br>
						</br>
						
						When I'm not at my computer I love to be outdoors, doing something stupid... I love hiking, mountaineering, skiing and climbing. I post some pictures of me doing said stupid things on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40_thieves/">Flickr</a> 

						</br>
						</br>

						I've been involved in Scouting since I was very young, and I've been an Assistant Scout leader in <a href="http://1finch.org.uk/">my group</a> for a while now, which basically means that I help out with weekly meetings and camps whenever I can. And I love doing it - teaching new skills is brilliant.

						I've worked at <a href="http://www.kisc.ch">Kandersteg International Scout Centre</a>, taking groups of kids hiking and mountaineering around the Swiss Alps. KISC is basically my favourite place in the world, and I'm hoping to go as soon as possible. I posted all my pictures and thoughts while there at my <a href="http://kandersteg.posterous.com">Kandersteg blog</a>.
						
						</br>
						</br>

						I'm also into watching F1 and playing ultimate frisbee (yes, Ultimate is definitely a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)">sport</a>). I occsionally write, rant and rave about them on the Twitter too.

						</br>
						</br>

						And if that hasn't answered your questions, then you can always drop me an <a href="mailto:alasdairsmith100@gmail.com">email</a> to get the juicy details.
